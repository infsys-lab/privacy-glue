1,"At Ericsson, we understand that privacy is an important issue for users of (visitors to) the Ericsson Internet site www.ericsson.com and its related domains. The following information is designed to help visitors understand what information we collect from our site, and how we handle and use the information after that. 

Information collection and use

Ericsson is the sole owner of any information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Ericsson may collect information from our users at several different points on our website. Ericsson may also transfer the information collected to any relevant unit within Ericsson, and located anywhere in the world. 

General enquiries

If a user contacts Ericsson with a general enquiry, the user may need to provide Ericsson with personal information (for example contact details). Ericsson will use this personal information to respond to the enquiry and track further correspondence. Information is also used to compile statistics on response handling, etc. This is done in aggregate, and no individual names or other personal information are retained. Personal information collected is not used for any other purpose. 

Cookies

Cookies are small text files that a site transfers to a user's (visitor's) hard disk or browser for added functionality or for tracking site usage. In order to measure the effectiveness of our online presence, Ericsson may use cookies to determine the path users take on our site and to identify repeat users of our site. We do not use cookies to gather personal information such as a person's name or e-mail address.

Cookies can be saved to the hard disk, but so-called session cookies are saved to the browser only and disappear when the browser is closed. On the ericsson.com homepage (and similar top or index pages), we use cookies that are saved to the hard disk and therefore remain after the browser is closed. Such cookies determine the path users take on our site and also identify repeat users of our site, although not by names or email addresses. On other pages of our site, we use session cookies to determine the path users take on our site. On some pages, we may also use non-session cookies.

It is possible to configure your browser to reject cookies by modifying the browser settings or preferences. If you wish to do so, we recommend you consult the information provided in the browser or contact the browser vendor for help and instructions.

Any information gathered by the use of cookies is compiled on an aggregate, anonymous basis. 

Examples of the use of cookies include: 

Subscriptions 

If a user wishes to subscribe to Ericsson information such as press releases or financial reports, we ask for an email address. Ericsson will use this e-mail address only to send the requested information; we will not send other unsolicited information.

How to subscribe and unsubscribe: Users may open or cancel subscription(s) at any time by filling in the form on http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/press/subscribe/index.shtml. 

Orders, surveys and contests

We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and, sometimes, financial information (credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

From time to time our site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as gender, age, level of education). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. For contests, contact information will be used to register participants, notify the winners and award prizes, etc. 

Third-party services

We may partner with another party to provide these or other specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.

These parties are not allowed to use any personal information collected except for the purpose of providing these services. We do not share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.

Extranets

Extranets provide customer-specific content and functions. For this site to properly fulfill its obligation to Ericsson’s major customers, we must mutually agree on which personnel may access specific extranet content and use specific extranet functions. Ericsson uses cookies, together with additional security mechanisms, to identify and track the registered users who enter extranet or other restricted-access portions of www.ericsson.com (and its related domains). 

External links

This site may contain links to other sites. Please take note that Ericsson is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site. 

Changes to Ericsson's Internet privacy policy

Ericsson may, from time to time, make changes to this policy. We recommend that users of this site re-visit this privacy policy on occasion to learn of new privacy practices or changes to our policy. 

How to contact Ericsson about this privacy policy

It's important to us at Ericsson to hear what users have to say about our services, and our policies. If site users have any questions, concerns, or complaints about this privacy policy, or want to let us know what they think about any of our off-line and on-line products and services, they can use our ""Questions and comments"" form accessible from almost every page on this site.

2,"## Privacy policy

NERC's website does not store or capture personal information, but for administration purposes merely logs the user's IP address which is automatically recognised by the web server.

## Cookies policy

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task;
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested;
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.



You can use your web browser's settings to manage these small files yourself.

## Our use of cookies

### Cookies for improving service

We use analytics cookies primarily to monitor which browser types and operating systems people are using. This enables us to create a site that works with many different browsers, improving the service we can offer.

_utmz | randomly generated number + info on how the site was reached (eg directly or via a link, organic search or paid search) | 6 months  
  
More details on these cookies can be found on the Google Code pages.

You can  disable these cookies so we can't record this information.

### Cookie for recording the enabling/disabling of cookies

This cookie records whether you wish to enable or disable cookies. If you elect to disable the above cookies this cookie is used to record your decision so you are not prompted each time you visit this site. 

Name | Typical content | Expires  
---|---|---  
cookieConsent | single letter to record acceptance of cookies | 1 year  
  
### Essential cookies for user settings and tracking

Microsoft ASP.NET (a web application framework on which this website is hosted) sets cookies to track a user moving around the website and to remember their selections or preferences that they've already made when looking at information or using a service:

Name | Typical content | Expires

ASP.NET_SessionId | randomly generated number | when user exits browser  
  
This website would not function without this cookie. For further details on the cookies set by Microsoft ASP.NET, please refer to the Microsoft website.

## How to control and delete cookies

We will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. 

However, if you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by our websites, or indeed any other website, you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how.

Alternatively, you may wish to visit www.aboutcookies.org which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers. You will also find details on how to delete cookies from your machine as well as more general information about cookies.

Please be aware that restricting cookies may impact on the functionality of our website.

If you wish to view your cookie code, just click on a cookie to open it. You'll see a short string of text and numbers. The numbers are your identification card, which can only be seen by the server that gave you the cookie.  
For information on how to do this on the browser of your mobile phone you will need to refer to your handset manual.

This statement outlines how we will use and protect information that you provide us about yourself.

  1. 1\. How we use your personal data


  1. 2\. Your rights under the Data Protection Act 1998
  2. 3\. Social media 
  3. 4\. Website security: how we protect your information
  4. 5\. Use of cookies and social variables



## 1\. How we use your personal data

We may collect personal information about you if you take part in a consultation, if you request to join one of our mailing lists or if you register with us as a doctor.

### Registration of doctors

If you provide your details when enquiring about registration or sitting the Professional Linguistic Assessment Board (PLAB) test we will use that information for the following purposes:

  * To process your enquiry or application
  * To compile statistics
  * We will supply information to the Department of Health, professional, education and training bodies so they can compile statistics
  * We may retain details of your application on our files and may disclose that information to overseas regulators in the EEA and elsewhere.



### Revalidation of doctors

If you provide your details when enquiring about revalidation, confirming whether you have a prescribed connection, or submitting an annual return, we will use that information for the following purposes:

  * To process your enquiry or annual return
  * To determine how to revalidate you
  * We may contact, and disclose information to your appraiser(s), bodies and/or organisations to which you have provided medical services, any Responsible Officer or Suitable Person who you have had a connection to since your last revalidation and overseas regulators in the EEA and elsewhere where you have been registered
  * We may retain information provided by you for revalidation on our files and may disclose that information to overseas regulators in the EEA and elsewhere.



If you subsequently obtain registration from the GMC, or if you provide information for the purposes of revalidation, we may additionally use this information to:

  * update the registers
  * administer and maintain your registration
  * process complaints
  * compile statistics and undertake research. We may work in partnership with external researchers to do this.
  * keep you updated with information about the GMC including guidance and news*



*We work hard to avoid cluttering up your inbox. We use technology to tailor the material we send you. We use 'open tracking' in our email campaigns. If you open one of our emails and download the images contained in the email, or click on a link contained within the email, we will record this information. This helps us to understand your professional interests and develop our communications based on your preferences. If you do not wish to participate in 'open tracking', you can configure your email application (Outlook, Hotmail, Gmail etc) to prevent the downloading of email images and you should not click through the links contained in the email.

How we categorise doctors' information and who we'll share it with:

Level 1 information – is published in the List of Registered Medical Practitioners (LRMP) on our website and made available to any enquirer. It consists of registered doctors’ reference number, gender, name, year and place of primary medical qualification, registration status, date of registration and any publicly available fitness to practise history.

Level 2 information – is a registered doctor’s Level 1 information plus the date on which their annual retention fee is due. We give it out in response to telephone or written enquiries.

Level 3 information - is registered doctors’ Level 1 and 2 information plus date of birth, photograph, passport details, registered email address, registered address and whether a doctor is subject to investigation under the fitness to practise procedures. We will only give Level 3 Information to UK health departments, employers, designated bodies, Responsible Officers, Suitable Persons and other bodies where appropriate.

Some organisations may ask us for your registered address so they can contact you about the services they provide. These may include the British Medical Association, medical defence organisations and medical Royal Colleges and faculties so they can keep their records up to date. We will only give your Level 3 information to them where we are satisfied you are already a member and haven’t asked us not to share with them. If you would like to update your preference for us to share your registered address with these organisations please let us know either by writing to Registration Update Team, General Medical Council, 3 Hardman Street, Manchester M3 3AW or by sending an email to registrationhelp@gmc-uk.org.

### Third Party Service Providers

We have contracts with other organisations (or Third Parties) to carry out certain activities or services on our behalf. If we need to pass any of your personal data to them we will make sure that:

  * They are only provided with the information they need to carry out the service
  * They agree not to use the information received from us for any other purpose than those specified by us
  * They have the proper systems in place to protect personal data



### Equality and Diversity Information

The GMC is committed to treating everyone fairly and meeting our legal responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 and related legislation (such as the Human Rights Act 1998). One of the ways we do this is by asking people to provide information about their ethnicity, disability, gender, sexual orientation, religion and beliefs.

Giving us this information is optional. If you choose to give it to us, we will keep it confidential and hold it securely in line with data protection and other relevant legislation. We will use the information you give us to analyse and report on statistical trends in medical education and practice in the UK. We will anonymise any data we publish so you can’t be identified.

The information may be used by different teams at the GMC. We may also share your personal data with other parties if required by law, where ordered by a court, or where it is otherwise in the public interest (for example for research purposes). Where possible, data will be anonymised or aggregated before we share it with any other party

### Consultation

We invite feedback from you about the site and, from time to time, we use the site to carry out electronic consultation exercises. If you send comments to us via the site we will collect your comments and your contact details for the purposes of the consultation concerned.

The information you supply will be stored and processed by the GMC in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. Any reports published using this information will not contain any personally identifiable information, We may provide anonymised responses to the consultation to third parties for quality assurance, or approved research projects on request.

## 2\. Your rights under the Data Protection Act 1998

You may obtain confirmation of the basic information that we hold about you at any time. If it is incorrect we will promptly correct it when we have received the appropriate notice or evidence from you in writing.

You are also able to make a request for all information that we hold about you under section 7 of the Data Protection Act 1998. This request must be made in writing and we make a charge of £10 for each request.

## 3\. Social media

We use several social media sites to raise awareness of our work and promote good medical practice. Please note that your use of these sites will be subject to each one’s terms and conditions. Please read their Privacy and Cookie notices carefully and check your personal settings where appropriate to ensure you are happy with how your information will be used by the social media site. We don’t actively collect data you submit to any third party websites, but may collect aggregated information (that doesn’t identify you) in order to help us monitor access to our content. We use the following social media sites:

  * Twitter
  * Facebook

We are committed to keeping your information secure, including any financial transactions you make with us online.

We are accredited to the international information security standard ISO27001 and protect our IT infrastructure in line with industry standards and good practice. We also arrange for our systems and processes to be audited by independent experts.

## 5\. Use of Cookies and Session variables
