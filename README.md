PrivacyGLUE is the first comprehensive privacy-oriented NLP benchmark comprising 7 relevant and high-quality privacy tasks for measuring general language understanding in the privacy language domain. We release performances from the BERT, RoBERTa, Legal-BERT, Legal-RoBERTa and PrivBERT pretrained language models and perform model-pair agreement analysis to detect examples where models benefited from domain specialization. Our findings show that PrivBERT, the only model pretrained on privacy policies, outperforms other models by an average of 2â€“3% over all PrivacyGLUE tasks, shedding light on the importance of in-domain pretraining for privacy policies.

This repository functions as the official codebase for reproducing the PrivacyGLUE benchmark reported in our MDPI Applied Sciencies [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/6/3701) with citation information found [here](#Citation-classical_building). Additional information on the PrivacyGLUE tasks can be found in [here](#Tasks-runner). We direct readers to our paper for further details on our methodologies and results.

  ABSTRACT =     {Benchmarks for general language understanding have been
                  rapidly developing in recent years of NLP research,
                  particularly because of their utility in choosing
                  strong-performing models for practical downstream
                  applications. While benchmarks have been proposed in the legal
                  language domain, virtually no such benchmarks exist for
                  privacy policies despite their increasing importance in modern
                  digital life. This could be explained by privacy policies
                  falling under the legal language domain, but we find evidence
                  to the contrary that motivates a separate benchmark for
                  privacy policies. Consequently, we propose PrivacyGLUE as the
                  first comprehensive benchmark of relevant and high-quality
                  privacy tasks for measuring general language understanding in
                  the privacy language domain. Furthermore, we release
                  performances from multiple transformer language models and
                  perform model&ndash;pair agreement analysis to detect tasks
                  where models benefited from domain specialization. Our
                  findings show the importance of in-domain pretraining for
                  privacy policies. We believe PrivacyGLUE can accelerate NLP
                  research and improve general language understanding for humans
                  and AI algorithms in the privacy language domain, thus
                  supporting the adoption and acceptance rates of solutions
                  based on it.},
